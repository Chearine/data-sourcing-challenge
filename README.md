# Module 6 Challenge - data-sourcing-challenge

## Description
This code prepares data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. The data is extracted from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merged the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
